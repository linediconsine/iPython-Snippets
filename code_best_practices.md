# Work in progress - Data science best practices

### Code style
* *name_of_variables* As python best practice, the name of variables are lowercase and with _ as separation

### Code good practices (when possible try to...)
* Try to avoid *for* and use *apply* or *map* function [ vectorization ]
* [On jupyter notebooks] if I execute two times the same code block this should not change compare to 1 execution
* Use Checkpoints where you save data and explain what you archive
* Comment! Explain your code, the yoursel of the future will be very happy about that
